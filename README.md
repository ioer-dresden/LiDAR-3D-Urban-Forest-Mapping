# LiDAR-3D-Urban-Forest-Mapping

## Overview
This repository contains scripts for high-resolution area-wide mapping and 3D modeling of urban forests based on LiDAR point clouds. 
The workflow is designed for widely available LiDAR point clouds with a density of at least 4 pts/mÂ² and has been published in this article.
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127637
Processing steps: 

* Classification of the urban forest in an object-based data fusion approach combining the point cloud with multispectral aerial imagery and a 3D building model
* Detection, segmentation and parameterization of individual tree crowns 
* Efficient reconstruction and 3D modeling of tree crowns using geometric primitives

## Software 
The algorithms for the urban forest classification up to the parameterization of individual tree crowns are implemented as [ready-to-use workflow](/src/R/workflow_markdown.R) in *R*.  
Solely for the last step, the 3D modeling of the trees in the CityGML schema, the proprietary software *FME* from *Safe Software* is used. The [FME Workbench](/src/fme_workbench/Create_3D_Tree_Models_geojson2citygml.fmw) created to generate the semantic 3D tree models as well as [prototypic 3D tree models](/data/tree_prototypes) are available in this repository.  
Gridded building roof heights can be used as supplementary data for the identification of roof points. A *PostgreSQL* script to [rasterize roofs heights](/src/postgresql/3DCityDB_rasterize_lod2_roof_heights.pgsql) for 3D city models stored in a [3D City DatabasB](https://www.3dcitydb.org/3dcitydb/) is included in the repository.
